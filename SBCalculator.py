        # population groups. Our denominator is (n,m).
        #
        # In the numerator, we play games due to the programmer's cognitive biases.
        # As before, we broadcast-multiply (1- reduction/100) and service levels, so that
        # each facility's service level reduction is accommodated over all services.
        # Our result here is of shape (m,s). Let it be called SLR for convenience.
        # We want to broadcast-multiply SLR with
